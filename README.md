FloralHeaven is a full-stack web application designed to provide a seamless online flower shop experience. The application allows users to browse and purchase beautiful and unique flower arrangements for various occasions. This project demonstrates the integration of a backend server with a frontend interface to create a user-friendly e-commerce platform for flower enthusiasts.
